    <center>  <h1>Regular Cookies</h1>
      <h1>Regular cookies are the quintessential baked treat, known for their simplicity and versatility. Made with basic ingredients such as flour, sugar, butter, and eggs, they offer 
        a variety of textures depending on the recipe—some are soft and chewy, while others are crisp and crunchy. Their flavor is mildly sweet, allowing them to pair well with a wide
        range of mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit.</h1>

    <center><h1>Straberry Cookies</h1>
    <h1>Strawberry cookies bring a burst of fruity sweetness to the table.
      Often made with fresh strawberries, strawberry extract, or freeze-dried 
      strawberry powder, these cookies have a distinct pink hue and a soft, tender 
      texture. The natural tartness of strawberries balances well with the cookie’s 
      sweetness, making them a refreshing and unique alternative to more traditional flavors.</h1>

         <h1>Brownie cookies merge the best of both worlds: the rich, dense, and chocolatey
           taste of brownies with the crisp exterior of a cookie. These cookies are often soft
           and chewy in the center with a slightly crunchy edge, giving them a texture that satisfies
           both brownie and cookie lovers alike. They are packed with deep chocolate flavor, making them
           a perfect indulgence for chocolate enthusiasts.</h1>

                  <h1>White chocolate cookies are a luxurious twist on classic chocolate chip cookies. 
                    Made with buttery dough and filled with creamy white chocolate chunks, these cookies
                    offer a rich, sweet flavor. The smoothness of white chocolate complements the cookie’s
                    soft or slightly crisp texture, creating a balanced and indulgent treat that is less intense 
                    than dark chocolate but still deeply satisfying.</h1>
