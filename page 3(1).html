      <h1>Regular cookies are the quintessential baked treat, known for their simplicity and versatility. Made with basic ingredients such as flour, sugar, butter, and eggs, they offer 
        a variety of textures depending on the recipeâ€”some are soft and chewy, while others are crisp and crunchy. Their flavor is mildly sweet, allowing them to pair well with a wide
        range of mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit.</h1>
